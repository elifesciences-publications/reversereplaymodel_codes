# reversereplaymodel_codes
Python/C++ codes for simulations in T Haga, T Fukai, Recurrent network model for learning goal-directed sequences through reverse replay

Python codes depend on numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn. Making movie files depends on ffmpeg.

Change to each directory and execute codes by "bash exec.sh" or "bash batch.sh".
